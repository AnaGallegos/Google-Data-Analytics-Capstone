This analysis is an optional Capstone project from the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) on Coursera. 

### Background:
Since 2013, Bellabeat has been a high-tech manufacturer of gorgeously crafted smart products for women with a focus on their health. Bellabeat has quickly expanded and established itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women by educating and empowering women with knowledge about their own health and habits.

Urka Sren, co-founder and chief creative officer, is confident that analysis of non-Bellebeat consumer data, such as usage data from FitBit fitness trackers, will reveal additional growth opportunities.

### Business Task:
Analyze FitBit fitness tracker app data to learn how users interact with the app and to find trends and information for the Bellabeat marketing team.
### Business Objectives:
- What are the trends identified?
- How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
- How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

### Tools:
Python for Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Visualisation and Data Analysis

### Data Set:
The data set is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit)
